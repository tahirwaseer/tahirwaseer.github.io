I am a web developer, currently leading web team at [AcclivousByte](http://acclivousbyte.com/). We build web and mobile app solutions for small and large originasations.

When not at office I am usually reading about new break throughs in Deep Learning, traing some nueral network and sometime watching fictional/fantasy tv show. You can find me on Twitter at [@tahirwaseer](http://twitter.com/tahirwaseer), [Linkedin](https://pk.linkedin.com/in/tahir-waseer) and [Github](https://github.com/tahirwaseer).
